# Frequency Principle (1D)

DNNs often fit target functions from low to high frequencies.  

The first figure shows the evolution of the function in spatial domain, the red line is the target function, and the blue line is the DNN output. *Ordinate vs. Abscissa : y vs. x*. 

The second figure shows the evolution of the function in Fourier domain, the red line is the FFT of the target function, and the blue line is the FFT of DNN output. *Ordinate vs. Abscissa: amplitude vs. frequency*.

### Core objective

Explore the generality of the frequency principle. Is it a universal law? What design should we do in the experiment?

### Report requirements

The relationship between the frequency principle and a series of hyperparameters. Choose one or two hyperparameters for experimental research in the report. Specific hyperparameter options can be found in the task section.
